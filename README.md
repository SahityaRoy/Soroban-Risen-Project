# Calculator Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple smart contract written in Rust using the Soroban SDK. The smart contract provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## File Breakdown

### `src/lib.rs`

This file contains the implementation of the CalculatorContract struct and its associated methods. These methods perform arithmetic operations on two integer inputs and return the result.

### `Cargo.toml`

The Cargo.toml file is the manifest file for Rust projects. It specifies project metadata and dependencies. In this case, it includes the Soroban SDK as a dependency.

### `.gitignore`

This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It typically includes build artifacts and other files that are generated during the development process.

### `README.md`

This file provides an overview of the project, including instructions for building, testing, and using the smart contract. It also includes information about the file breakdown and project structure.

## Usage

To use this smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-smart-contract.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd calculator-smart-contract`
3. Build the project: `cargo build`
4. Test the smart contract: `cargo test`
5. Deploy the smart contract to your desired blockchain platform using the Soroban SDK.
